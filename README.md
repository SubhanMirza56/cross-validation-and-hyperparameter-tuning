🔁 CROSS-VALIDATION — What & Why?
✅ What is it?
Cross-validation is a technique to evaluate how well your model generalizes to unseen data by testing it on different subsets of the dataset.

🧠 Why Use It?
To avoid overfitting (model too specific to training data)

To avoid underfitting (model too simple to capture patterns)

To get a more reliable estimate of performance

📊 Types of Cross-Validation:
Method	Description
K-Fold	Splits the data into K equal parts. Train on K-1, test on 1. Repeat K times.
Stratified K-Fold	Like K-Fold but preserves class ratio. Best for classification.
Leave-One-Out (LOO)	Each sample is its own test set. High computation.
ShuffleSplit	Randomly splits the data multiple times. Flexible.
TimeSeriesSplit	For time-series problems. Keeps time order.

🔁 Example with K-Fold:
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)

print("Fold-wise scores:", scores)
print("Average accuracy:", scores.mean())
🔧 HYPERPARAMETER TUNING — What & Why?
✅ What are Hyperparameters?
Parameters that are set before training the model.

Unlike model weights, these are not learned automatically.

Examples:

n_estimators, max_depth in Random Forest

C, penalty in Logistic Regression

learning_rate, batch_size in Deep Learning

🎯 Why Tuning is Important?
Choosing the right hyperparameters can:

Improve accuracy

Reduce overfitting or underfitting

Improve training speed

🔍 Tuning Methods:
Method	Description	Use Case
Grid Search	Tries all combinations of hyperparameters	Small search spaces
Random Search	Tries random combinations from hyperparameter space	Large search spaces
Bayesian Optimization	Uses previous results to choose next best combo	Complex models
Manual Search	Trial-and-error tuning by hand	Quick checks

🧪 Example: Grid Search with Cross-Validation
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100],
    'max_depth': [None, 10],
    'criterion': ['gini', 'entropy']
}

model = RandomForestClassifier()
grid = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)
grid.fit(X, y)

print("Best Parameters:", grid.best_params_)
print("Best Score:", grid.best_score_)
✅ How They Work Together:
You typically combine both:

Use Cross-Validation to evaluate model performance.

Use Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize that performance.
